Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations.<br/><br/>If you have time, I'd love it if you submit a PR for changes in the community_contributions folder - instructions in the resources. Also, if you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations.

      "[\"Designing a society from scratch involves integrating a variety of principles that ensure sustainability, justice, and harmony among individuals while recognizing the crucial balance between individual rights and the collective good. Here are the core principles I would prioritize:\\n\\n### Core Principles\\n\\n1. **Sustainability**:\\n   - **Environmental Stewardship**: Foster a deep respect for the planet by promoting renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and conservation of biodiversity. Implement circular economy practices to minimize waste and resource depletion.\\n   - **Resilience**: Design infrastructure and communities to be resilient to climate change and natural disasters, ensuring the longevity and adaptability of resources.\\n\\n2. **Equity and Justice**:\\n   - **Social Equity**: Ensure equal access to resources, opportunities, and rights regardless of one's background. Create systems to identify and rectify injustices and disparities.\\n   - **Participation**: Encourage active participation in decision-making processes at all levels, giving everyone a voice in shaping the policies that govern their lives.\\n\\n3. **Technological Integration**:\\n   - **Accessible Technology**: Leverage technology to enhance quality of life, provide education, and improve healthcare. Ensure that technological advancements are accessible to all, not just a privileged few.\\n   - **Ethical Innovation**: Establish guidelines for ethical development and use of technology, prioritizing transparency, privacy, and the well-being of individuals over profit.\\n\\n4. **Community and Connection**:\\n   - **Social Cohesion**: Promote a strong sense of community by encouraging collaboration, empathy, and mutual support among individuals. Offer platforms for cultural exchange and understanding.\\n   - **Education for All**: Provide holistic education that fosters critical thinking, emotional intelligence, and global citizenship, preparing individuals to contribute positively to society.\\n\\n5. **Holistic Well-being**:\\n   - **Health and Mental Wellness**: Ensure access to healthcare, mental health resources, and a healthy work-life balance, recognizing the interconnectedness of physical, mental, and social health.\\n   - **Cultural Appreciation**: Celebrate and protect diverse cultural identities, traditions, and languages, fostering a rich societal tapestry that enhances creativity and innovation.\\n\\n### Balancing Individual Rights and Collective Good\\n\\n1. **Deliberative Democracy**: Implement a system of governance that emphasizes deliberative democracy, where citizens engage in open dialogues to address conflicts between individual rights and collective needs. This could involve town hall meetings, citizen assemblies, and referendums for major decisions.\\n\\n2. **Rights with Responsibilities**: Promote the idea that individual rights come with responsibilities toward the community. For instance, while freedom of speech is protected, it should also be emphasized that this freedom must not infringe on others' rights or well-being.\\n\\n3. **Conflict Resolution Mechanisms**: Establish fair and transparent conflict resolution mechanisms to address disputes arising from the tension between individual and collective interests. This could include mediation processes, legal avenues, and restorative justice practices that consider the impact on both parties.\\n\\n4. **Flexible Policies**: Design policies that consider the diversity of circumstances among individuals while promoting the collective good. For example, subsidies for sustainable practices that individuals can opt into while still providing alternatives for those unable to participate.\\n\\n5. **Continuous Feedback Loops**: Create an adaptive governance model that welcomes feedback from citizens to assess policies' effectiveness concerning individual rights and collective needs, allowing for modifications based on real-world outcomes and experiences.\\n\\nBy prioritizing these principles and approaches, the designed society can strive for harmony between individual aspirations and the overarching goal of collective sustainability and justice. This balance will require ongoing dialogue, compassion, and commitment from all members of the community.\", \"Designing a society from scratch requires careful consideration of various factors to create a sustainable, equitable, and just community.

       "4. **Environmental Stewardship**: Prioritize environmental sustainability through policies such as renewable energy adoption, eco-friendly infrastructure development, and sustainable agriculture practices. Emphasize education and awareness-raising initiatives to ensure all members share in the responsibility for maintaining the planet's well-being.\n",

Develop programs to equate computer skills or even coding classes to provide equitable opportunities for participation and integration into modern society.\n",

       "3. **Hybrid Governance Models**: Explore hybrid governance models that blend elements of liberal democracy (e.g., the separation of powers) with collaborative, grassroots approaches like participatory economics or post-scarcity economies.\n",
       "4. **Holistic Education Programs**: Establish education systems that emphasize cross-disciplinary skills training (science-technology-arts-humanities-social sciences-compassionate empathy), developing interdependent thinking skills to foster cooperation as well as individual autonomy.\n",
       "5. Addressing systemic inequalities by targeting policy adjustments specifically towards marginalized groups: Incorporate inclusive decision-making processes, promote diversity and representation at all levels of governance, address the root causes of historical disparities with targeted support programs, and offer accessible pathways for upward social mobility where appropriate.\n",
